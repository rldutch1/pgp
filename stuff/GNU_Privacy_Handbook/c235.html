>Key tampering is a major security weakness with public-key cryptography.
An eavesdropper may tamper with a user's keyrings or forge a
user's public key and post it for others to download and use.
For example, suppose Chloe wants to monitor the messages that Alice
sends to Blake.
She could mount what is called a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>man in the 
middle</I
> attack.
In this attack, Chloe creates a new public/private keypair.
She replaces Alice's copy of Blake's public key with the new public key.
She then intercepts the messages that Alice sends to Blake.
For each intercept, she decrypts it using the new private key, reencrypts
it using Blake's true public key, and forwards the reencrypted
message to Blake.
All messages sent from Alice to Blake can now be read by Chloe.</P
><P
>Good key management is crucial in order to ensure not just the integrity
of your keyrings but the integrity of other users' keyrings as well.
The core of key management in GnuPG is the notion of signing keys.
Key signing has two main purposes: it permits you to detect tampering
on your keyring, and it allows you to certify that a key truly belongs
to the person named by a user ID on the key.
Key signatures are also used in a scheme known as the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>web of 
trust</I
> to extend certification to keys not directly signed by you 
but signed by others you trust.
Responsible users who practice good key management can defeat key
tampering as a practical attack on secure communication with GnuPG.</P

>A keypair has a public key and a private key.
A public key consists of 
the public portion of the master signing key,
the public portions of the subordinate signing and encryption subkeys, and 
a set of user IDs used to associate the public key with a real person.
Each piece has data about itself.
For a key, this data includes its ID, when it was created, when it
will expire, etc.
For a user ID, this data includes the name of the real person it identifies,
an optional comment, and an email address.
The structure of the private key is similar, except that it contains only
the private portions of the keys, and there is no user ID information.</P

>When you distribute your public key, you are distributing the public
components of your master and subordinate keys as well as the user IDs.
Distributing this material alone, however, is a security risk since
it is possible for an attacker to tamper with the key.
The public key can be modified by adding or substituting keys, or by
adding or changing user IDs.
By tampering with a user ID, the attacker could change the user ID's email
address to have email redirected to himself.
By changing one of the encryption keys, the attacker would
also be able to decrypt the messages redirected to him.</P
><P
>Using digital signatures is a solution to this problem.
When data is signed by a private key, the corresponding public key
is bound to the signed data.
In other words, only the corresponding public key can be used to
verify the signature and ensure that the data has not been modified.
A public key can be protected from tampering by using its corresponding
private master key to sign the public key components and user IDs, thus
binding the components to the public master key.
Signing public key components with the corresponding private master
signing key is called <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>self-signing</I
>, and a public key that has
self-signed user IDs bound to it is called a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>certificate</I
>.</P
><P
>As an example, Chloe has two user IDs and three subkeys.
The signatures on the user IDs can be checked with the command

they are not shown by the GnuPG interface.</P

>Both new subkeys and new user IDs may be added to your keypair after
it has been created.
A user ID is added using the command 
<A
HREF="r899.html#ADDUID"
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>adduid</B
></A
>.
You are prompted for a real name, email address, and comment just
as when you create an initial keypair.
A subkey is added using the command 
<A
HREF="r899.html#ADDKEY"
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>addkey</B
></A
>.
The interface is similar to the interface used when creating an initial
keypair.
The subkey may be a DSA signing key, and encrypt-only ElGamal
key, or a sign-and-encrypt ElGamal key.
When a subkey or user ID is generated it is self-signed using your 
master signing key, which is why you must supply your passphrase
when the key is generated.</P
><P
>Additional user IDs are useful when you need multiple identities.
For example, you may have an identity for your job and an identity
for your work as a political activist.
Coworkers will know you by your work user ID.
Coactivists will know you by your activist user ID.
Since those groups of people may not overlap, though, each group
may not trust the other user ID.
Both user IDs are therefore necessary.</P
><P
>Additional subkeys are also useful.
The user IDs associated with your public master key are validated by
the people with whom you
communicate, and changing the master key therefore requires recertification.
This may be difficult and time consuming if you communicate with
many people.
On the other hand, it is good to periodically change encryption subkeys.
If a key is broken, all the data encrypted with that key will be
vulnerable.
By changing keys, however, only the data encrypted with the one broken
key will be revealed.</P
><P
>Subkeys and user IDs may also be deleted.
To delete a subkey or user ID you must first select it using the
<A
HREF="r899.html#KEY"
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>key</B
></A
> or 
<A
HREF="r899.html#UID"
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uid</B
></A
> commands respectively.
These commands are toggles.
For example, the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>key <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>2</I
></TT
></B
> 
selects the second subkey,
and invoking <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>key <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>2</I
></TT
></B
> again 
deselects it.
If no extra argument is given, all subkeys or user IDs are deselected.
Once the user IDs to be deleted are selected, the command
<A
HREF="r899.html#DELUID"
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>deluid</B
></A
>
actually deletes the user IDs from your key.
Similarly, the command <A
HREF="r899.html#DELKEY"
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>delkey</B
></A
>
deletes all selected subkeys from both your public and private keys.</P
><P
>For local keyring management, deleting key components is a good way
to trim other people's public keys of unnecessary material.
Deleting user IDs and subkeys on your own key, however, is not always
wise since it complicates key distribution.
By default, when a user imports your updated public key it will be merged
with the old copy of your public key on his ring if it exists.
The components from both keys are combined in the merge, and this
effectively restores any components you deleted.
To properly update the key, the user must first delete the old version
of your key and then import the new version.
This puts an extra burden on the people with whom you communicate.
Furthermore, if you send your key to a keyserver, the merge will
happen regardless, and anybody who downloads your key from a keyserver
will never see your key with components deleted.
Consequently, for updating your own key it is better to revoke key
components instead of deleting them.</P

Normally, a user ID collects signatures that attest that the user ID
describes the person who actually owns the associated key.

never change.
