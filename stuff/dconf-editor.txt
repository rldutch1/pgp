Change the cache timeout:
Launch dconf-editor.
Navigate to desktop - gnome - crypto - cache.
change gpg-cache-method to idle or timeout.
change gpg-cache-ttl to the number of seconds you want the passphrase to be cached.
Restart the gnome-keyring daemon $ gnome-keyring-daemon -r

idle means that the timer is reset each time you use the key before timeout is reached. timeout means that simply the time elapsed since entering the passphrase is considered.

This only works for GPG-keys. Passphrases for SSH-keys are still cached until the end of the session.
