>GnuPG is a tool for secure communication.
This chapter is a quick-start guide that covers the core functionality
of GnuPG.
This includes keypair creation, exchanging and verifying keys, encrypting
and decrypting documents, and authenticating documents with digital
signatures.
It does not explain in detail the concepts behind public-key cryptography,
encryption, and digital signatures.
This is covered in Chapter <A
HREF="c173.html"

>2</I

>.
It also does not explain how to use GnuPG wisely.

>GnuPG uses public-key cryptography so that users may communicate securely.
In a public-key system, each user has a pair of keys consisting of
a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>private key</I
> and a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>public key</I
>.
A user's private key is kept secret; it need never be revealed.
The public key may be given to anyone with whom the user wants to
communicate.
GnuPG uses a somewhat more sophisticated scheme in which a user has
a primary keypair and then zero or more additional subordinate keypairs.
The primary and subordinate keypairs are bundled to facilitate key
management and the bundle can often be considered simply as one keypair.</P

Please select what kind of key you want:

   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (4) ElGamal (sign and encrypt)
Your selection?</PRE

GnuPG is able to create several different types of keypairs, but a primary
key must be capable of making signatures.
There are therefore only three options.
Option 1 actually creates two keypairs.
A DSA keypair is the primary keypair usable only for making signatures.
An ElGamal subordinate keypair is also created for encryption. 
Option 2 is similar but creates only a DSA keypair.
Option 4<A
NAME="AEN33"
HREF="#FTN.AEN33"
>[1]</A
> creates a single ElGamal 
keypair usable for both making signatures and performing encryption.
In all cases it is possible to later add additional subkeys for encryption
and signing.
For most users the default option is fine.</P
><P
>You must also choose a key size.
The size of a DSA key must be between 512 and 1024 bits, and an ElGamal
key may be of any size.
GnuPG, however, requires that keys be no smaller than 768 bits.
Therefore, if Option 1 was chosen and you choose a keysize larger than
1024 bits, the ElGamal key will have the requested size, but the DSA
key will be 1024 bits.

>About to generate a new ELG-E keypair.
              minimum keysize is  768 bits

    highest suggested keysize is 2048 bits
What keysize do you want? (1024)</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

The longer the key the more secure it is against brute-force attacks,
but for almost all purposes the default keysize is adequate since
it would be cheaper to circumvent the encryption than try to break it.
Also, encryption and decryption will be slower as the
key size is increased, and a larger keysize may affect signature length.
Once selected, the keysize can never be changed.</P
><P
>Finally, you must choose an expiration date.
If Option 1 was chosen, the expiration date will be used for both the
ElGamal and DSA keypairs.

         0 = key does not expire

      &lt;n&#62;w = key expires in n weeks

      &lt;n&#62;y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

For most users a key that does not expire is adequate.
The expiration time should be chosen with care, however,
since although it is possible to change the expiration date after the key
is created, it may be difficult to communicate a change
to users who have your public key.</P
><P
>You must provide a user ID in addition to the key parameters.
The user ID is used to associate the key being created with a real
person.

></TR
></TABLE

Only one user ID is created when a key is created, but it is possible
to create additional user IDs if you want to use the key in two or
more contexts, e.g., as an employee at work and a political activist
on the side.
A user ID should be created carefully since it cannot be edited after
it is created.</P

>GnuPG needs a passphrase to protect the primary and subordinate 
private keys that you keep in your possession.

There is no limit on the length of a passphrase, and it should be
carefully chosen.
From the perspective of security, the passphrase to unlock the private
key is one of the weakest points in GnuPG (and other public-key 
encryption systems as well) since it is the only protection you 
have if another individual gets your private key.
Ideally, the passphrase should not use words from a dictionary and
should mix the case of alphabetic characters as well as use 
non-alphabetic characters.
A good passphrase is crucial to the secure use of GnuPG.</P

certificate for the primary public key using the option
<A
HREF="r721.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="OPTION"

If you forget your passphrase or if your private key is compromised 
or lost, this revocation certificate may be published to notify others
that the public key should no longer be used.
A revoked public key can still be used to verify signatures made
by you in the past, but it cannot be used to encrypt future messages
to you.
It also does not affect your ability to decrypt messages sent to
you in the past if you still do have access to the private key.

The argument <TT

specifier</I

either the key ID of your primary keypair or any part of a user ID
that identifies your keypair.
The generated certificate will be left in the file

>.
If the <A
HREF="r1197.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="OPTION"
>--output</SPAN
></A
> option is 
omitted, the result will be placed on standard output.
Since the certificate is short, you may wish to print a hardcopy of
the certificate to store somewhere safe such as your safe deposit box.
The certificate should not be stored where others can access it since
anybody can publish the revocation certificate and render the
corresponding public key useless.</P
